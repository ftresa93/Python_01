It is used when a method that does not need access to class or instance state and behaves like regular function.\n",

        "\n",
        "A23. In Python, polymorphism works with inheritance by allowing a child class to define a method with the same name as a method in its parent class, but with a different implementation. This enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method in different ways. This is also know as method overriding. The child class can then extend or modify the functionality of the method, if it wants.\n",
